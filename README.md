#Waterproof case for COTS 1.3" OLED modules

##Summary:

The case utilizes acrylic layers to create the enclosure and the seal is provided via an o-ring. The internal is easily accessible via a bolt-on back cover and a cable feedthru is provided by a PG7 cable gland. The internal volume is large enough for the display and a small mcu board (pro mini, teensy, esp, etc) and control can be provided by capacitive sensing (untested) through the front bezel plate. Additional layers can be stacked on to increase the internal volume as required.


##Features:

- CNC cut acrylic
- O-ring seal for fast, simple and reliable sealing
- Engraved front panel allows for capacitive touch input
- Non-glare clear acrylic window

##Sealing the unit:

- Clean and inspect the o-ring groove ensuring no debris is trapped inside
- Clean and inspect the sealing surface on the inside of the back cover
- Lightly lubricate the o-ring
- Install o-ring and back cover
- Inspect the o-ring seal compression.  Look for a prominent black line (need photo) where the o-ring is compressed against the back cover.
